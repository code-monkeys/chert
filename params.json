{"name":"Chert","tagline":"A simple URL minifier using silex","body":"# Chert\r\n\r\nChert is your own URL minifier in less than 5 minutes. Built with [Silex][1], you only need one command for setup and have you personal bit.ly or goo.gl.\r\n\r\n[![SensioLabsInsight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/9f580b96-d77a-4b78-b94f-254ad13cebaf/mini.png)](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/9f580b96-d77a-4b78-b94f-254ad13cebaf)\r\n \r\n## Requirements\r\nChert requires the following basics to run out-of-box.\r\n* PHP 5.3.8+\r\n* [Composer][2]\r\n* The [PDO SQLite][4] driver (or Mysql)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nUsing CLI, type the following : \r\n\r\n    $ composer install pygillier/chert\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nInstallation process will create the file `app/settings.yml`. You need to rename it to `settings.yml` and ensure that SQLite database `chert.sqlite` is writable to have a running Chert instance.\r\n\r\n### Alternate database (MySQL, PGSQL, ...)\r\n\r\nChert can use any [PDO compatible][4] DBMS.\r\n\r\nAs Chert is based on Doctrine DBAL, database configurations options in Chert are the same as the one used in [DBAL configuration][3]. An SQL script is provided for MySQL, it can be easily converted to others RDBMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web-access\r\nChert's entry point is `web/index.php`. In order to have shorter URLs and protect your configuration file, you need to redefine vhost document root to  `web/` directory. For more details, see the Silex [webserver configuration page](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/web_servers.html).\r\n\r\n### Settings.yml reference\r\nEverything is documented in `settings.yml-dist`.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOpen your favorite browser and go to Chert URL. Enter an URL in input field then save. You're done!\r\n \r\n \r\n[1]: http://silex.sensiolabs.org/\r\n[2]: http://getcomposer.org\r\n[3]: http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html\r\n[4]: http://php.net/pdo\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
