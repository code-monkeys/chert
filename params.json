Feel free to change the values and tune your setup as you wish.\r\n\r\n### Alternate database (MySQL, PGSQL, ...)\r\n\r\nChert can use any [PDO compatible][4] DBMS.\r\n\r\nAs Chert is based on Doctrine DBAL, database configurations options in Chert are the same as the one used in [DBAL configuration][3] (example for MySQL is present in `settings.yml-dist`. An SQL script is provided for MySQL, it can be easily converted to others RDBMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Web-access\r\nChert's entry point is `web/index.php`. In order to have shorter URLs and protect your configuration file, you may redefine vhost document root to  `web/` directory. An apache htaccess file is provided.\r\n\r\n### Settings.yml reference\r\nEverything is documented in `settings.yml-dist`. A better explanation will come.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOpen your favorite browser and go to Chert URL. Enter an URL in input field then save. You're done!\r\n \r\n \r\n[1]: http://silex.sensiolabs.org/\r\n[2]: http://getcomposer.org\r\n[3]: http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html\r\n[4]: http://php.net/pdo\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
